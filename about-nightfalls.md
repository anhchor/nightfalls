title: About Nightfalls
---

Grandmaster Nightfalls are Nightfall strikes on the highest difficulty. They have unforgiving modifiers and require coordination and planning among the team.


## Modifiers

All Grandmaster Nightfalls have the following modifiers:

- **Chaff**: radar is disabled.
- **Equipment Lock**: you can't change your loadout (weapons, armour, mods, subclass) once you begin.
- **Match Game**: enemy shields are highly resistent to non-matching elemental damage.
- **Limited Revives**: your team starts with 4 revives. Each Champion defeated gets you +1 revive. If you run out of revives, you wipe. After 45 minutes, revives no longer work. You cannot self-revive and must be revived by a teammate.
- **Extinguish**: if you wipe, you go back to orbit.
- **Contest Mode**: your equipment is capped at 1345, and enemies are at 1370.
- **Join In Progress Disabled**: you can't join a GM that's in-progress.



## Rewards

If you get **Platinum Completion** by defeating all Champions, you get:

- Ascendent Shards (common)
- Enhancement Prisms (commmon)
- Nightfall Weapon (common)
- Exotic Armour (common)

## Builds

These are based on personal experience.


### Mods

- **Protective Light** (CWL, Void, 2 energy)
- **Taking Charge** (CWL, 3 energy)
- **Particle Deconstruction** (Class Item, 7 energy) – if using Fusion / Linear Fusion Rifles
- **Focusing Lens** (Class Item, 3 energy) – if someone is running Stasis. Weapon damage when inside a Well of Radiance counts, so the Stasis team member can also use this. -->
