## Summary

Heavy on ad-clear efficiency. Clear spawns immediately, before progressing. Lower plates gradually, stop when enemies spawn to clear them, then continue lowering. Damage boss slowly, stop when enemies spawn, then continue.


## Champions

- **Overload**: they throw lanterns.
- **Unstoppable**: they have long-range lightning attacks.


## Shields

- **Arc** (1): in the room with the two plates.
- **Solar** (2): one in the room with the two plates; another spawns in a boss room wave.



## Strategy

The main goal is ad-clear. It's very easy to get overwhelmed in the boss room and wipe. Watch out for Void snipers, which can one-shot you.


### Tank Room

- Two snipers, one in the left and one on the right, when you first get to the room
- Lower the plate gradually, and step off when things spawn at about 90%. This prevents the tank from spawning in as well, so you can focus on ads and Champions.
- The tank puts up its bubble and opens the crit spot in its head when one of its legs breaks. The bubble can be broken with Super damage. Ads spawn when the tank's head closes again.


### Plates Room

- Lower one plate at a time. Step off when ads spawn.
