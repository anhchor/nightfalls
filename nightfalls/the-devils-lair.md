<!-- ## Walkthrough

### Entrance

Go along the far right side to skip enemies. At the entrance to the building, clear enemies from afar before going in.


### Ghost Scanning Room


### Tank Area

- The tank will one-shot you, and splash damage from the laser can kill you. Don't be anywhere near the shot. Breaking one of the tank's legs will disable it for a short while, preventing it from shooting its laser attack.
- Watch for snipers in the back.
- The skiff will one-shot you.
