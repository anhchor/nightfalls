## Summary

Destroying the Taken blights in reverse order (3 → 2 → 1) prevents waves of Champions and ads from spawning. There are lots of Taken boop cannons, and it's easy to get physics killed. Boss needs to be melted, otherwise the boss room gets very messy.


## Champions

- **Overload**: they have a long-range Void attack.
- **Unstoppable**: their shield attacks will one-shot you.



## Shields

- **Arc** (3): two in the very beginning, and one mini-boss before you enter the building.
- **Solar** (many): enough throughout the strike that you probably don't want to rely on heavy ammo to pop them.
- **Void** (1): one Void mini-boss wizard towards the end.



## Strategy

Lake of Shadows is a relatively easy nightfall, so it's forgiving on what strategy you use. It's recommended to prioritize burning down the boss, because surviving in the boss room would be very challenging.


### Taken Blights

Destroy them in reverse order (3 → 2 → 1). This prevents waves of ads and Champions from spawning in. This does not affect Platinum Rewards, as the Champions don't spawn in at all.


### Bridge

Watch out for Taken boop cannons in the walls that will launch you off the map or into walls.


### Boss Room

The boss room gets chaotic, so it's important to burn down the boss as quickly as possible. Suggested loadouts for this:

- Well of Radiance / Titan Bubble
- 3x Falling Guillotine
- 3x One Thousand Voices

### Ammo

Aeon gauntlets are recommended. There are three Overload Champions leading up to the boss room that are easy to use a finisher on.
