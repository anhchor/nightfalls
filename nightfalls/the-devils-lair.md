### Entrance

Go along the far right side to skip enemies. At the entrance to the building, clear enemies from afar before going in.


### Ghost Scanning Room

Standing on the balcony behind the ghost scanning is relatively safe if you have a Well. Occasionally ads will spawn from the door behind you.


### Tank Area

- The tank will one-shot you, and splash damage from the laser can kill you. Don't be anywhere near the shot. Breaking one of the tank's legs will disable it for a short while, preventing it from shooting its laser attack.
- Watch for snipers in the back where the tank is, along the far right side when you first enter, and on the building.
- A Fallen skiff drops off reinforcements and will one-shot you.


### Boss Room

This is an ad-heavy encounter with spawns happening throughout, though by hanging out in the left room you'll be pretty safe.

- Occasionally, the boss may teleport right outside the window of the left room and look at you.
- There are four Void servitors for each of the two immune phases.
- At the boss's second immune phase, two Overload captains will spawn.
