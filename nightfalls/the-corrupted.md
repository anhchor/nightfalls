## Walkthrough

### Entrance

Shoot down the mini-boss's Axiom darts because they will kill you.


### Elevator Room

You must charge the orbs by passing them to your teammates, before breaking the enemy shields with it.


### Double Ogre Room

Killing the large ogre before the Champions will despawn them. You can do this to save time and ammo, though it will prevent Platinum completion.
